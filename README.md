The data is available at https://zenodo.org/record/6473954 for the CESM2(WACCM6) SSP2-4.5 simulations and at https://zenodo.org/record/6473775 for the CESM2 ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations; extreme precipitation indices are available at https://zenodo.org/record/7552583 for the CESM2 simulations and at https://zenodo.org/deposit/7922503 for the UKESM1 simulations. Complete output from all 10 members of CESM2(WACCM6) SSP2-4 simulations and ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations is freely available the NCAR Climate Data Gateway at https://doi.org/10.26024/0cs0-ev98 and https://doi.org/10.5065/9kcn-9y79 respectively. Data for the UKESM1 ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations is available at https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/deposited2022/arise and the data for the UKESM1 SSP2-4.5 simulations is available on the Earth System Grid Federation database.
